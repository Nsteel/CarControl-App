<h3><font color="#000044">Controlling the Car</font></h3>
<p>Several control schemes exist for moving the model car and can be selected by clicking the three dots on the top right of the screen on the menu bar.</p>

<h5><font color="#000044">Random Walk</font></h5>
<p>In this mode, the car drives until nearing an obstacle and then turns a random amount and continues driving.</p>

<h5><font color="#000044">Joystick Control</font></h5>
<p>In this mode the car can be controlled with the joystick on the bottom right of the screen.</p>

<h5><font color="#000044">Tilt Control</font></h5>
<p>In this mode, on devices with accelerometers, the car can be controlled by tilting the android device. Tilt forward or backwards to drive forward or reverse and left or right to turn. Tapping the joystick will recalibrate the tilt sensor.</p>

<h5><font color="#000044">Simple Waypoint Control</font></h5>
<p>In this mode, the car will follow the trail marked by the placed Waypoints. See the <b>LaserScan view</b> for placing and viewing Waypoints.</p>

<h5><font color="#000044">Waypoint Control</font></h5>
<p>Similar to <b>Simple Waypoint Control</b>, in this mode the car uses a potential field calculated from it's laser scanner to navigate around obstacles.</p>

<h3><font color="#000044">Navigation Drawer Views</font></h3>
<p>Once connected to the model car, the navigation drawer on the left can be opened to choose from the following screens:</p>

<h5><font color="#000044">The Overview screen</font></h5>

<p>The <b>Overview screen</b> contains both the <b>Camera screen</b> and the <b>Car screen</b>.</p>

<h5><font color="#000044">The Camera screen</font></h5>

<p>The <b>Camera screen</b> shows the view from the car's camera.</p>

<h5><font color="#000044">The Car screen</font></h5>

<p>The <b>Car screen</b> option shows obstacles sensed by the car's Kinect. The blue arrow indicates the car's current direction in relation to the scan data.</p>
<p>This screen also shows the current Waypoint trail used by the various Waypoint control modes. Waypoints can be dropped or deleted with a double tap and moved by selecting them via a long press. Dropping a Waypoint on the existing trail will insert it into the trail.</p>

<h5><font color="#000044">Preferences</font></h5>

<p>The <b>Preferences</b> allows you to edit a variety of settings including the ROS topics you are connected to and warning options.</p>
